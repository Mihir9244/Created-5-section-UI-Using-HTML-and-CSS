# Created-5-section-UI-Using-HTML-and-CSS
This project displays a sleek and modern UI layout with Six sections, including a navigation bar, Four content sections, and a footer, all built using HTML and CSS. The layout is designed with semantic elements for better structure and readability. Each section incorporates colorful visuals and images that enhance the overall clarity and appeal of the interface.

To add to the aesthetics, the design features smooth hover effects on card and navigation bar. When users hover over buttons like "Learn More," "Contact Us," and "Discover More," subtle animations make the interactions more dynamic. The color scheme blends neutral tones with vibrant highlights, making it both professional and engaging. The footer contains essential links and contact information, organized neatly for easy access.

This combination of color and hover effects creates an appealing and user-friendly experience, making the design both visually engaging and functional.
